This will hopefully turn into an sdl game engine written in C++ and SDL (+ OpenGL)... I plan to implement this during the next LDjam :-)

## compiling
Install following SDL packages with your package manager:
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf
* SDL_mixer

Compile with following flags:
* -lSDL2_ttf
* -lSDL2_image
* -lSDL2_mixer

## TODO
* custom width for input fields
* transitions between scenes
* animator class
* transforms
* math & physics library

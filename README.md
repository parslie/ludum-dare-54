This will hopefully turn into an sdl game engine written in C++ and SDL (+ OpenGL)... I plan to implement this during the next LDjam :-)

## hacktoberfest / contributing
If you want to contribute to this repository, keep in mind that:
* This is under active development and will go through many changes during time period 29th of september - 3rd of october.
* If you want inspiration for what to contribute with, look for TODO-comments.
* I like to use feature branches & merge them into main when fully implemented.

## compiling
Install following SDL packages with your package manager:
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf
* SDL_mixer

Compile with following flags:
* -lSDL2_ttf
* -lSDL2_image
* -lSDL2_mixer

## TODO
* custom width for input fields
* transitions between scenes
* transforms
* math & physics library
* editor user interface
